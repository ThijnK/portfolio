          Hi, I’m Thijn—a Computer Science graduate from Utrecht University,
          with a broad interest in software development. I enjoy working across
          the stack, from frontend to backend, using a variety of programming
          languages and technologies. Outside of coding, I like to run, read,
          and occasionally lose track of time gaming.

          Alongside my studies, I’ve been working as a freelance developer for
          about four years, building everything from landing pages and
          dashboards to Discord bots and automation tools. I graduated magna cum
          laude from both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, completing honors
          programs alongside each.
